            <p>The Smiths were an iconic English rock band hailing from Manchester, formed in 1982 and disbanded in 1987. Known for their influential sound and dynamic songwriting partnership between Morrissey (vocals) and Johnny Marr (guitar), the band also included Andy Rourke (bass) and Mike Joyce (drums). They released four studio albums: <i>The Smiths</i> (1984), <i>Meat Is Murder</i> (1985), <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> (1986), and <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i> (1987). Throughout their career, they garnered a massive fan base and left a lasting mark on alternative rock, particularly in the British independent music scene of the 1980s.</p>
        
            <p>The band's distinct sound blended 1960s rock with post-punk, standing in stark contrast to the popular synthesizer-based dance pop of the time. Marr's jangly guitar, influenced by Roger McGuinn of The Byrds, became a defining feature, inspiring future Manchester bands like The Stone Roses and Oasis. Morrissey's clever lyrics and unique sense of humor explored ordinary people's lives, making their music relatable and enduring.</p>
        
            <p>While their commercial success outside of the UK was limited, all four of The Smiths' studio albums reached the UK top five, with one topping the charts. Their singles, several of which were not part of any album, further cemented their legacy. Despite disbanding in 1987, The Smiths remain one of the most important and influential British guitar groups of the 1980s, with their music still captivating fans to this day.</p>
